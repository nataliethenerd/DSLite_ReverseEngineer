Nintendo DS Lite Schematics I made based on scans I created of the 6 layer PCB

Kinda a WIP. I am not happy with the power schematic. Some of the test pads are wired a bit weird, that was so they would work the same as they do on the original board when I drew it up in KiCad.
There may be some inaccuracies with values and layout. I am a hobbyist, not an electrical engineer at Nintendo.
